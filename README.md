# PE-Packer-Crypter-FUD
Updated version of the Atom PE Packer, with a FUD stub that bypasses windows defender! Enjoy!

A PE packer that packs your PE exe (portable executable) inside another one and executes it inside memory. Program and stub both written in C, not any of that dotnet garbage. Supports x64 PE files. Currently bypassing windows defender as of 10/3/2024. Will be updated frequently, enjoy!
